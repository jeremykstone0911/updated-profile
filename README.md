  * Screenshot of the deployed application


#### Design

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

    * Profile picture

    * Bio

    * Location

    * Email

    * Link to your portfolio

### Updated LinkedIn Profile 

Update your LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github and portfolio.
